package oops; //this current class2

//local variable are variables declared inside the methods or constructor
//instance variables are variables that are declared inside the class but outside of all the methods. Moreover instance variables have default values assigned.
//With instance variables, you can specify different access modifiers like public, private, protected and default

//when there is same variable name for both instance and local variables, then the compiler could get confused and print its default values.c
//We can mitigate this using this keyword

//this keyword can be used to call the current class instance variablel
